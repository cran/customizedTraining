Description: Customized training is a simple technique for transductive
    learning, when the test covariates are known at the time of training. The
    method identifies a subset of the training set to serve as the training set
    for each of a few identified subsets in the training set. This package
    implements customized training for the glmnet() and cv.glmnet() functions.
